Okay hi, my name is Arif. I'm going to tell you about a topic. First of all, the speaker used a moderate number of filler words, which were primarily used at the beginning of their sentences. Next, the use of filler words slightly detracts from the overall professionalism and flow of the speech. This potentially lowers the audience perception and confidence of the speaker themselves. Thank you.
